# Shoutem UI

Shoutem UI is a set of styleable components that enables you to build beautiful React Native applications for iOS and Android. All of our components are built to be both composable and [customizable](http://github.com/shoutem/theme). Each component has a predefined style that is compatible with the rest of the Shoutem UI, which makes it possible to build complex components that look great without the need to manually define complex styles.

## Install

These instructions are valid for React Native 0.60.0 and higher. If you're running a lower version, please use v1.X.X.

```
$ npm install --save @shoutem/ui
```

We have a `postinstall` script which will add `@shoutem/ui`'s native dependencies to your root `package.json` in order to support autolinking and pod installation.

## Docs

All the documentation is available on the [Developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io/docs/ui-toolkit/introduction).
